    <h4>Course Description:</h4>
    <p>
      This course focuses on programming and problem-solving using Python,
      tailored for quantitative finance applications. It covers software
      development principles, testing, and style, with topics ranging from
      functions and iteration to object-oriented programming and GUIs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
    <p>
      Learning Outcomes: Procedural Proficiency: Develop fluency in procedural
      statements, including assignments, conditional statements, loops, and
      method calls, as well as arrays. Design, code, and test small Python
      programs for quantitative finance applications, using top-down design
      principles.
      <br />
      Object-Oriented Understanding: Grasp the fundamentals of object-oriented
      programming in Python, such as classes, subclasses, inheritance, and
      overriding, and apply these concepts to quantitative finance problems.
      <br />
      Algorithmic Knowledge: Gain a foundation in searching and sorting
      algorithms, as well as the basics of vector computation, essential for
      tackling quantitative finance challenges.
